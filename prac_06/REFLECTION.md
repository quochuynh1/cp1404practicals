# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Not much has changed since the last reflection in terms of my process. I am still watching the lecture recordings
in my dedicated time slots, and completing practical work on time. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think I need to improve my planning when writing programs. Rather than diving straight into coding from the bottom up, 
I should start by planning how the program is going to run, and work my way down to the finer details. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am doing well to keep up with the lecture content, as well as starting the practical work early so I have plenty of time
to check my work. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop neglecting python terminal to "experiment" with different concepts. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It's currently lecture recess and I have only received feedback from prac 01. This seems like a very long time to wait 
for some feedback even though I have attended all the seminars and practical sessions. I hear that Townsville students 
receive their feedback within 12 hours, so I don't think it's fair that Cairns students should have to wait this long for 
theirs. Feedback is critical to help me learn and understand where I am going wrong, so without it, I am continuing to 
submit work that isn't to my fullest potential.
