# What did you see on line 1?
# I saw that each time I pressed enter, with print(random.randint(5,20)), it would print a random integer ranging from 5 to 20. The smallest number I could've seen was 5 while the largest was 20.

# What did you see on line 2?
# I saw that each time I pressed enter, with print(random.randrange(3, 10, 2)), it would print a random integer in the range from 3 to 10 in steps of 2. Therefore, the possible outputs would be 3, 5, 7, 9 and 4 would not be produced.

# What did you see on line 3
# I saw that each time I pressed enter, with print(random.uniform(2.5, 5.5)), it would print a float ranging from 2.5 to 5.5. The smallest number I could've seen was 2.5 while the largest was 5.5.
